# Iris

  The development of this project started during Hackthon USP competition in 2017, which goal was to produce a small and fast-designed webpage, mobile or hardware application that would help the improvement of scientific development in universities.
  The initial team was formed by electric engeneering students from the _Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo_. For almost a day, we developped a small static wepage which worked as a hypothesis test for a system that would solve 2 main problems they encounter during their academic lives:
...The unfamiliarity of reaserchers with *lower cost* equipments and their presence in other laboratories or institutes that these reaserchers are not very used to. This causes doubled expenses with a considerable amount of equipments that are re-bought.
...Facilitate the access from employees, researchers and students to the university's equipments, as well as external companies.
  The system presented at the end of the competition earned a honorable mention and some people's attention.
  Weeks later, we realized that we could bring benefits to our University, so we decided to countinue developping **Iris**. The first step taken was crawling data from our university's web systems in order to full our databases. 
  Now, in 2018, we seek the complete development of the project.
